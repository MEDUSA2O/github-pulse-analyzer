## API Rate Limits

This application uses the GitHub public API, which has rate limits:

- For unauthenticated requests: 60 requests per hour
- For authenticated requests: 5,000 requests per hour

The current implementation uses unauthenticated requests, so it may hit rate limits with frequent use.

## Future Enhancements

- Add authentication to increase API rate limits
- Add more visualizations (language breakdown, contribution calendar)
- Support for viewing organization profiles
- Compare two different GitHub users

## License

This project is open source and available under the MIT License.
